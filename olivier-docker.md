Olivier is a team lead at Docker, focusing on "distributing containers" (pack, sign, ship, store, deliver, verify).
Previously worked in a serie of startups (including a Street View copycat), and chiefly interested in large storage, web-services scalability, high-volume http and bittorrent architectures.
